# RobustMutliProcessComputation

This an assignment of the course "Operating Systems". In this mini project we have a main process controlling sub-processes called workers and a subprocess called the cache server. Chains of subtasks are given to the server and subtasks of each chain are done by the computational work of a worker. the main process is supossed to deal with subprocesses being destroyed randomly and manage the progress of the chains.
